# Classification_Project



## Project Objectives
- Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploratory data analysis and statistical testing, modeling, and model evaluation), findings, and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook Final Report.

- Create modules (acquire.py, prepare.py) that make your process repeateable and your report (notebook) easier to read and follow.

- Ask exploratory questions of your data that will help you understand more about the attributes and drivers of customers churning. Answer questions through charts and statistical tests.

- Construct a model to predict customer churn using classification techniques, and make predictions for a group of customers.

- Refine your work into a Report, in the form of a jupyter notebook, that you will walk through in a 5 minute presentation to a group of collegues and managers about the work you did, why, goals, what you found, your methdologies, and your conclusions.

- Be prepared to answer panel questions about your code, process, findings and key takeaways, and model.

## Business Goals
- Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?

- Construct a ML classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.

- Deliver a report that a non-data scientist can read through and understand what steps were taken, why and what was the outcome?

# Audience
-Your target audience for your notebook walkthrough is your direct manager and their manager. This should guide your language and level of explanations in your walkthrough.

# Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook Report
- README.md file containing the project information
- CSV file with customer_id, probability of churn, and prediction of churn
- Acquire and prepare files
- Notebook walkthrough presentation

# Preliminary Questions:

### Why are our customers churning?
(data exploration needed)

## Why are our customers staying?
(data exploration needed)

## Can we predict churn?
